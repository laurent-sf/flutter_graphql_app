# flutter_graphql_app

A small application to learn how to use graphql caching mechanism.

## Run
- Start the [graphql-server](https://github.com/laurent-sf/graphql-server).
- If you are runing the app on a real device:
    - Ensure your phone is connected to the wifi.
    - Update `url` in the `main.dart` file to the one corresponding to your machine (have a look to this [post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4779963/how-can-i-access-my-localhost-from-my-android-device/19387755#19387755) if needed).
